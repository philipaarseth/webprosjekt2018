## WordPress-Git Red Flags
### Somethings to think about
There are a few problems endemic to using Git and WordPress together:

* How do you handle wp-config.php since it will be different on the local and production servers and you don’t want it exposed in a public repository?

* How do you deal with media files? Does it make sense to copy them all from the production server to your local development environment on a periodic basis?

* Does it make sense to include the entire WordPress core and third-party themes and plugins in your Git repository, or should you limit Git’s tracking to custom plugins and custom theme modifications?

* How do you keep the database updated between the local and production servers?
